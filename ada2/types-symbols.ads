   --  Tests seem to show that this solution is a few percents faster
   --  than Ada.Strings.Unbounded.

   --  As a side effect, some frequent string comparisons (with "def!"
   --  or "fn*" for example) will become a bit more efficient because
   --  comparing pointers is faster than comparing strings.

   --  It would be natural to store a Cursor from the global
   --  dictionnary into Ptr, but this actually reduces the speed,
   --  probably because it significantly increases the size of
   --  Mal_Type.
